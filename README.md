# cvi-webtools
Javascript tools for managing and working with Core-Values personal profiles.

This will allow a web-page to create a "drawing" similar to that on the CVI report.

Additional tools will include:
   -a meeting/group charting tool
       (So everyone can see the "overall" core-values represented by the group)
